        For this project, I modified an existing interface and performed an A/B test
        and statistical analysis to learn the impacts of two different UI designs.

            For the A/B tests, the users were asked to purchase $150 worth of cacti. When the user clicked on the link 
            for the cacti website, they either received the A interface or the B interface.

      <div id="box3">
        <div id="p">
          When running the statistical tests, I looked at two metrics:
          time to completion and return rate. Before analyzing the results,
          I came up with a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis for each metric. 
        </div>
        <div id="p2">
          Hypotheses for Time to Completion:
        </div>
        <div id="p3">
          Null hypothesis: The time to completion for A and the time to completion for B are equal. 
        </div>
        <div id="p3">
          Alternative hypothesis: The time to completion for A is less than the time to completion
          for B because the add to cart options are vertically aligned with the images of the cacti, allowing users to read the text quickly from top to bottom. 
        </div>
        <div id="p2">
          Hypotheses for Return Rate: 
        </div>
        <div id="p3">
          Null hypothesis: The return rate for A and the return rate for B are equal. 
        </div>
        <div id="p3">
          Alternative hypothesis: The return rate for A is higher than the return rate for B because the prices of the cacti are further away from the images of the cacti as well as the + Cart button which may cause users to forget or not think about how much they are spending when pressing the + Cart button. 
          Thus, more users may find themselves checking their cart and returning to the main page.

        <div id="p">
          During studio, our class tested each other's A/B sites to collect data. I first shared the 
          link for my cacti website, which included the A and B versions of the interface, to my classmates. 
          As mentioned before, the task was to fill the shopping cart with at least $150 worth of cacti, and each user
          received either the A version or the B version of the interface. After studio, I extracted the data from logs that were recorded through the Heroku app, which I used to
          deploy my website. Then, I moved the data to an Excel spreadsheet in order to analyze the data.

            <li>One limitation of this A/B test is that the sample size is too small. Because I was only
              able to collect data from 24 users, my results may not be representative of a bigger population.

          </div>
          <div id="p">
            <li>My data might have also been skewed because more users tested the B interface compared to the A interface. 
              While 16 users tested the B interface, only 8 users tested the A interface.

            <li>It would be interesting if I ran the test with different populations. Because I ran the test with only students, 
              the results may have ben different if I ran the test with a different population, such as older adults.
